//Business Logic:

1. array to check for vowels
2. array to check for constonants
3. array to check for qu at the beginning of a word only
4. array that will move words around add way or ay to the end of words.
5. function that takes the form and pushes it through to the UI after running through the arrays

//User Interface: 
function for form submission 
window.onload for the "final product"
